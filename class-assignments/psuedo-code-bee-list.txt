1. extract column 4 from the file (because we only need the names) and save output as a list
2. replace the '&' characters with ','  
3. remove the special characters in the list
4. remove the numbers
5. remove a capital letter followed by a period 
6. sort the file alphabetically
7. 

NEW PSEUDO CODE:

#for each element in the list
#   step through each char and find the first capital one
#   when you find the first capital one, step through until you find a space or a comma
#   take what is between the capital and the space/comma
#   put what you took out (the name) in a dictionary
#      if the name is already in dictionary, add one to it's count
#      else if the name is not in dictionary (new name) then add it to dictionary and give it count 1 as the value
#   continue through the end of the list entry
#   repeat for all elements the author list

#now that you have the dictionary

#for each element in the dictionary
#look at name
