Working With Files and Directories

Creating Files a Different Way
1. The ‘touch’ command created a new text file. The file shows up after typing the 'ls' command while on the directory.
2. Since the file is blank, it is 0 bytes.
3. The ‘touch’ command allows you to create a blank text file for programs that require
such files to populate with its output.

Moving Files to a new folder
mv sucrose.dat maltose.dat ../raw

Renaming Files
I actually had to do this! I renamed call_exercises to class_exercises during lecture on Tues.
1. No. The command ‘cp’ would only allow you to copy the file, not rename the existing file.
2. Yes.
3. No. Although ‘mv’ is the correct command, this line does not provide a new name.
4. No. ‘cp’ will allow you to copy the file, not rename the existing file. Also, there isn’t a new name listed.

Moving and Copying
1. No. The file is located at /Users/jamie
2. Yes.
3. No. The file is located at /Users/jamie/data/recombine
4. No. the file is located at /Users/jamie

Using rm Safely
The -i option will ask you to confirm whether or not you want to delete a file (Y = yes delete; N = no do not delete). This precautionary option is important so that you don’t accidentally delete something forever.

Copy with Multiple Filenames
If there are multiple file names followed by a directory, then the ‘cp’ command will copy the files into the directory. If there is no directory noted after the file, there will be an error.

List filenames matching a pattern
1. The wildcard between the ‘t’ and the ‘a’ allows it to recognize 0 or more characters in
this space. We want to narrow the search further.
2. I originally took this to mean that the ‘t’ is considered optional, but it appears as though the issue is that it does not account for 2 characters in between ‘t’ and ‘ne’, so it won’t consider the ‘thane’ ending.
3. This works.
4. This only shows files starting with ‘ethane.’

More on wildcards
cp *calibration.txt backup/calibration
cp 2015-11-* send_to_bob/all_november_files/
cp *-23-dataset* send_to_bob/all_datasets_created_on_a_23rd/

Organizing Directories and Files
mv *.dat analyzed

Reproduce a folder structure
1. I am not as familiar with this form of reproducing folder structure, but this method is effective.
2. This is effective. This is the way I usually reproduce a folder structure.
3. This will not work because there is no buildup of folders. I.e. the intermediate level folders must be created first.
4. Since the command ‘cd data’ was not typed, the commands created ‘raw’ and ‘processed’ at the level of ‘data’
